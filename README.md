Given a set S of n integers, and another number M, we want to determine
whether or not there exist 2 numbers in S whose sum is exactly M. The algorithm
of testing all possible 2 numbers in S will take O(n
2
) time and it is unacceptable.
a) Design a more efficient algorithm for solving this problem. Analyze the time
complexity of your algorithm.
b) Extend your algorithm for the following case: determine whether or not there
exist 3 numbers in S whose sum is exactly M.

How to implement merge-sort such that the extra space used is about n/2 where n
is the number of input elements?
